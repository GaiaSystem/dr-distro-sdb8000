# Data Respons build system


## How To Use

External recipe sources are included in the project as git submodules.
These modules need to be initialized on first use:

Start of by initializing git

`$ git submodule update --init`

OpenEmbedded (BitBake) relies on the build environment providing a large
set of environment variables.  These are most easily set up by sourcing
the provide 'env' script:

`$ . ./env`

This will generate artifacts under the build sub-folder.
If you need more flexibility in where to build do:

```
$ export TEMPLATECONF=<top of project>/build/conf
$ export DR_CM_COMMIT=`git -C <top of project> describe --tags --long --dirty`
$ export DR_BUILD_PLAN=<name of your build>
$ export DR_BUILD_NO=<yout build number if needed>
$ export BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE="DR_BUILD_PLAN DR_BUILD_NO DR_CM_COMMIT"
$ source <top of project>/oe-core/oe-init-build-env build <top of project>/bitbake/
```
And now you can build:

```
$ DISTRO=your-distro MACHINE=your-machine bitbake your-image
```
